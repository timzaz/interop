Preamble

The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a free software license, and any
software released under this license is free software: everyone is free
to use, copy, modify, and distribute it, with or without a fee.

The GPL is a copyleft license, which means that derivative works of GPL-licensed
software must also be released under the GPL. This is to ensure that
everyone has the same freedoms with the software.

The GPL is designed to protect the freedoms of software users. It ensures
that everyone who uses a GPL-licensed program can run, study, modify, and
redistribute the software, and that they can do so without any restrictions.

The GPL is also designed to ensure that software developers can share and
collaborate on software. It encourages the development of free software by
making it easy for others to use, modify, and share GPL-licensed software.

The GPL is a powerful tool for protecting the freedoms of software users.
It is a flexible license that can be used for a wide variety of software.

The GPL is a living license, and it is constantly being updated to
address new technologies and challenges. The Free Software Foundation
encourages everyone to use the GPL and to help keep it up-to-date.
